proposal id must be 8-char and unique

1. create dao: 
  ./dao.sh create-proposal description=3 name=2 id=0011223300112237

2. add step: 
  ./dao.sh add-step  proposalId=0011223300112237 incentiveRate=10 description=3 name=2  amount=3000 sender=6EbhsCu7nDMRYGNXkBNBtcx1gubjrUfR8aQ2ZfPzg2Ur receiver=H2knp7o4asKD79eo1PSPAFcahqAXgk6eQUkCcmAExXFU token=988Hp2QxjbcZu3vgy78CRsNhxnS46YG4nubbYeePgoxa executeAfter=1000

3. get info 
  ./dao.sh get-proposal-by-id proposalId=0011223300112237

  after this steps, fund is sent from sender to vault and locked, amount = 1000 + 1000 * (incentive_rate = 10) / 100000
  ./dao.sh approve-step proposalId=0011223300112237 stepIndex=2

6. reject step - only after proposal is settled and not yet finalized (approved or rejected), and step not finalized (rejected/approved)
  after this cmd, proposal is rejected
  ./dao.sh reject-step proposalId=0011223300112237 stepIndex=1 reason=scam

  1000 sent to receiver, and caller get 1000 * (incentive_rate = 10) / 100000;
  ./dao.sh reject-step proposalId=0011223300112237 stepIndex=2

8. revert step - only proposal is rejected or expired (not finalized after expireOrFinalizeAfter) and step is approved not rerverted
