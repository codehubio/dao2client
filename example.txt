proposal id must be 8-char and unique

1. create dao: 
  ./dao.sh create-proposal description=test_desc name=test_name expireOrFinalizeAfter=0

2. add step: 
  ./dao.sh add-step  proposalPda=D4DG4UpTjvmfDnPCL8twcaLLndGRnUhgP7d96yPt5LxS incentiveRate=100 description=desc_1 name=desc_1  amount=1000 sender=6EbhsCu7nDMRYGNXkBNBtcx1gubjrUfR8aQ2ZfPzg2Ur receiver=H2knp7o4asKD79eo1PSPAFcahqAXgk6eQUkCcmAExXFU token=988Hp2QxjbcZu3vgy78CRsNhxnS46YG4nubbYeePgoxa executeAfter=1000
  ./dao.sh add-step  proposalPda=D4DG4UpTjvmfDnPCL8twcaLLndGRnUhgP7d96yPt5LxS incentiveRate=10 description=desc_2 name=desc_2  amount=2 sender=11111111111111111111111111111111 receiver=6EbhsCu7nDMRYGNXkBNBtcx1gubjrUfR8aQ2ZfPzg2Ur token=11111111111111111111111111111111 executeAfter=0
  ./dao.sh add-step  proposalPda=D4DG4UpTjvmfDnPCL8twcaLLndGRnUhgP7d96yPt5LxS incentiveRate=300 description=desc_3 name=desc_3  amount=3000 sender=H2knp7o4asKD79eo1PSPAFcahqAXgk6eQUkCcmAExXFU receiver=6EbhsCu7nDMRYGNXkBNBtcx1gubjrUfR8aQ2ZfPzg2Ur token=9jpftpYfAiZaQzyn7ngVfhGiEdKYWiP7TkJ3uAaS5qfu executeAfter=0

3. get info 
  ./dao.sh get-proposal-by-pda proposalPda=D4DG4UpTjvmfDnPCL8twcaLLndGRnUhgP7d96yPt5LxS

4. settle proposal - after this cmd, step cannot be added any more.
  ./dao.sh settle-proposal proposalPda=D4DG4UpTjvmfDnPCL8twcaLLndGRnUhgP7d96yPt5LxS

5. approve step - only after proposal is settled and not yet finalized (approved or rejected), and step not finalized (rejected/approved)
  if all steps were approved, proposal automatically changed to approved.
  after this steps, fund is sent from sender to vault and locked, amount = 1000 + 1000 * (incentive_rate = 10) / 100000
  ./dao.sh approve-step proposalPda=D4DG4UpTjvmfDnPCL8twcaLLndGRnUhgP7d96yPt5LxS stepIndex=2 approvedAmount=1000

6. reject step - only after proposal is settled and not yet finalized (approved or rejected), and step not finalized (rejected/approved)
  after this cmd, proposal is rejected
  ./dao.sh reject-step proposalPda=D4DG4UpTjvmfDnPCL8twcaLLndGRnUhgP7d96yPt5LxS stepIndex=1 reason=scam

7. execute step - only proposal is approved
  after this steps, fund is sent from vautl to receiver and caller: 
  1000 sent to receiver, and caller get 1000 * (incentive_rate = 10) / 100000;
  ./dao.sh reject-step proposalPda=D4DG4UpTjvmfDnPCL8twcaLLndGRnUhgP7d96yPt5LxS stepIndex=2

8. revert step - only proposal is rejected or expired (not finalized after expireOrFinalizeAfter) and step is approved not rerverted
  after this steps, fund is sent from vautl to sender
  1000 sent to sender, and caller get 1000 * (incentive_rate = 10) / 100000;
  ./dao.sh revert-step proposalPda=D4DG4UpTjvmfDnPCL8twcaLLndGRnUhgP7d96yPt5LxS stepIndex=2 approvalIndex=1


NOTE: 7 and 8 is incentivized to callers by paying them a small fee ()
